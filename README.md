# Pizzaiola-Adventures
An adventure for pizza!
*This is a WIP*.
Move the player by using the arrow keys and the space bar to jump. You can wall jump too!
Enemies can be killed by jumping on top of them.
Watch out for fireballs from the Canon and running into the enemies.
Don't fall off! If you do just refresh the page as I haven't updated the code to respawn yet!
Look for the floating collectibles to make the best pizza!
There is no finish level include or UI as this is still a work in progress!
Thanks!
